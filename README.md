An object detection web application that uses TensorFlow.js and COCO-SSD model to identify objects through a device's camera and match them with their corresponding brands in real-time.
# Object and Brand Detection

This project is a web-based application that utilizes TensorFlow.js and the COCO-SSD model to perform real-time object detection. The app uses the device camera to identify objects and display their names along with matching brand suggestions.

## Features
- Real-time object detection using the COCO-SSD model.
- Identification of objects like bottles, cell phones, and laptops.
- Mapping detected objects to corresponding brands (e.g., Coca-Cola, Apple, Dell).
- Fully responsive, works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
